## Higher School of Economics - Advanced Machine Learning Specialization
[Coursera Webpage](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml)

### Syllabus
This specialization gives an introduction to deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language understanding, computer vision and Bayesian methods. Top Kaggle machine learning practitioners and CERN scientists will share their experience of solving real-world problems and help you to fill the gaps between theory and practice. Upon completion of 7 courses you will be able to apply modern machine learning methods in enterprise and understand the caveats of real-world data and settings.

You will master your skills by solving a wide variety of real-world problems like image captioning and automatic game playing throughout the course projects. You will gain the hands-on experience of applying advanced machine learning techniques that provide the foundation to the current state-of-the art in AI.

### Prerequisites
As prerequisites we assume calculus and linear algebra (especially derivatives, matrices and operations with them), probability theory (random variables, distributions, moments), basic programming in python (functions, loops, numpy), basic machine learning (linear models, decision trees, boosting and random forests). Our intended audience are all people who are already familiar with basic machine learning and want to get a hand-on experience of research and development in the field of modern machine learning.
